# Spamocalypse: Infiltration
A remake of a stealth-based game that involves avoiding a cult of spammers

[Spamocalypse: Aftermath](https://gamejolt.com/games/spamocalypse-aftermath/198961) is a game I released in 2017, spending 2 years of my spare time on it. It was a first-person stealth-based game in the style of Thief/Thief 2, where the player was a thief hired to steal ~The Utah Teapot~ The Huta Teapot from a museum that had been overrun by a deranged cult of spammers known as the Word of Turscar.

I was a fairly junior software engineer when I started it, and my old code shows:
- No source control
- Unused code
- No testing beyond manual testing

However, I learned a lot on it. So, I decided to redo it and update the graphics several years later.
